This is the *PyLiT7* project, designed to provide a simple reStructuredText
processor for producing high-quality lecture notes and program documentation.

Why not just use Python Sphinx_ tool?

I did, for over a decade in my teaching at Austin Community College. However,
my lecture notes needed features that were hard to implement in Sphinx_, and I
found that forcing Sphinx_ to do things I wanted done was just plain painful.
So, this project is a fresh start on a tool that can incorporate my ideas. 

Read the notes that accompany this project. They tell the story of the creation
of this tool. The style of these notes may not be what you expect in an
open-source project, but the target audience for my writing is always students,
trying to learn a new craft.

..  note::

    Getting students to actually sit down and read something is quite a task. I
    keep my writing light, and more personal in an effort to keep them engaged!
